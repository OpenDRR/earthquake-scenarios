[general]
description = Magnitude 4.9 earthquake scenario along the Vedder fault which strikes 050 degrees and is located approx 18 km E of Abbotsford City Hall according to the British Columbia Geographic Warehouse fault map. Assuming a non vertical fault plane, oblique thrust faulting is inferred based on fault strike plus tectonic stress regime and maximum horizontal stress  orientations in World Stress Map by Heidbach et al 2016.
