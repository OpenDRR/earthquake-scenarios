[general]
description = Magnitude 5 earthquake scenario along an unnamed fault which strikes 290 degrees and is located approx 15 km NNE of Burnaby City Hall and directly south of Mt Elsay according to the British Columbia Geographic Warehouse fault map. Assuming a non vertical fault plane, thrust faulting is inferred based on fault strike plus tectonic stress regime and maximum horizontal stress orientations in World Stress Map by Heidbach et al 2016.
