description = Magnitude 5.5 earthquake scenario along an unnamed thrust fault which strikes 290 degrees and is located directly SE of Ladysmith center according to the British Columbia Geographic Warehouse fault map. Thrust faulting is consistent with the current tectonic stress regime and maximum horizontal stress orientations in World Stress Map by Heidbach et al 2016.
